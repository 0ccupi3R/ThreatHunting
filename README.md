# The ThreatHunting Project
An informational repo about hunting for adversaries in your IT environment.

## Organization
The core of this repository are the techniques in the *hunts* directory.  Each technique gets it's own file, which is simply a brief overview to explain the what the technique is good for, what data it requires and any other important highlights.  Each file also contains references (usually in the form of links) to sources that describe the technique more fully.

In general, the expectation is that you may use the files in this collection to identify specific hunting techniques that are of interest to you, then follow the included references to read more and actually learn how to do it.

- Email us a public link to a blog posting, slide deck, etc that describes the technique in enough detail to allow someone to learn to perform it.  You may send your submissions to *hunts at threathunting d0t net*.

## Special Thanks
Like many community projects, this wouldn't be possible without the work of a lot of other people.

First and foremost, we'd like to thank all those brave hunters who share their techniques with the world.  We're only cataloging them, they did the hard work and we thank them for it.

Second, we'd like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to this repo.  Your contributions make it a little better every time, and we appreciate it.
