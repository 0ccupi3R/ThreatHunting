  "body": "# The ThreatHunting Project\r\nAn informational repo about hunting for adversaries in your IT environment.\r\n\r\n## Organization\r\nThe core of this repository are the techniques in the *hunts* directory.  Each technique gets it's own file, which is simply a brief overview to explain the what the technique is good for, what data it requires and any other important highlights.  Each file also contains references (usually in the form of links) to sources that describe the technique more fully.\r\n\r\nIn general, the expectation is that you may use the files in this collection to identify specific hunting techniques that are of interest to you, then follow the included references to read more and actually learn how to do it.\r\n\r\n### Threat Hunting Techniques By Topic\r\n\r\n* Attacker commands\r\n* Data hiding\r\n* Malware\r\n* Other\r\n* Unauthorized services\r\n* Webshells\r\n\r\n### Threat Hunting Techniques by Data Required\r\n\r\n## License\r\nHere's the deal, in plain English:\r\n\r\nThis repo is here for the community. You are free to use it for personal or commercial use provided you attribute it in some visible manner.  We suggest \"Data provided by the ThreatHunting Project, https://github.com/DavidJBianco/ThreatHunting\" or something substantially similar.  Please do include the URL, though, to help more people find us.\r\n\r\n## Contributing\r\nThere are two ways to contribute to this repository:\r\n\r\n- Fork this repo, edit the appropriate technique (or use the *TECHNIQUE TEMPLATE.md* file to create a new one), add it to the list in the appropriate topic and data categories, then send us a pull request.  **This is the preferrred method.**\r\n- Email us a public link to a blog posting, slide deck, etc that describes the technique in enough detail to allow someone to learn to perform it.  You may send your submissions to *hunts at threathunting d0t net*.\r\n\r\n## Special Thanks\r\nLike many community projects, this wouldn't be possible without the work of a lot of other people.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, we'd like to thank all those brave hunters who share their techniques with the world.  We're only cataloging them, they did the hard work and we thank them for it.\r\n\r\nSecond, we'd like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to this repo.  Your contributions make it a little better every time, and we appreciate it.\r\n",
