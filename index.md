Threat hunting is a popular topic these days, and
there are a lot of people who want to get started but don't know
how. What should they hunt for? How should they perform the hunts?
What data will they need to collect?

On the other hand, there are a lot of individuals out there who have
written blog posts, conference presentations or whatever that detail
some of their favorite hunting procedures. The problem is that they
are scattered and sometimes hard to find.

That's why the ThreatHunting Project exists. Here you will find links
to a number of different published hunting procedures. It my hope that
this will give you some concrete starting points, or if you are an
experienced hunter, help you find additional techniques to add to your
repertoire.

## Getting Started

The core of this repository are the techniques in the [hunts]({{ site.github.repository_url }}/blob/master/hunts)
directory. Each technique gets its own file, which contains a brief
summary the what the technique is good for, what data it requires and
any other important highlights. Each file also contains references
(usually in the form of links) to sources that describe the technique
more fully.

In general, the expectation is that you may use the files in this
collection to identify specific hunting techniques that are of
interest to you, then follow the included references to read more and
actually learn how to do it.

file to create a new one), add it to the list in the appropriate topic
and data categories, then send us a pull request. This is the

## Special Thanks

Like many community projects, this wouldn't be possible without the
work of a lot of other people.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all those brave hunters who
share their techniques with the world. The ThreatHunting Project is
only a catalog; the hunters who developed and published their
procedures did the hard work and we thank them for it.

Second, I'd like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to
this repo. Your contributions make it a little better every time, and
you are much appreciated.
