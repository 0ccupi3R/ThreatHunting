Threat hunting is a popular topic these days, and
there are a lot of people who want to get started but don't know
how. What should they hunt for? How should they perform the hunts?
What data will they need to collect?

On the other hand, there are a lot of individuals out there who have
written blog posts, conference presentations or whatever that detail
some of their favorite hunting procedures. The problem is that these
procedures are scattered all over the Internet, and are sometimes hard
to find.

That's why the ThreatHunting Project exists. Here you will find links
to a number of different published hunting procedures. It my hope that
this will give you some concrete starting points, or if you are an
experienced hunter, help you find additional techniques to add to your
repertoire.

## Getting Started

The core of this repository is the list of published hunting
procedures, which you will find on the sidebar.  You can either browse
the full list, or if you have a specific hunting objective in mind,
you can view that list indexed by goals.  Likewise, if you don't know
what to hunt for but you have some data, consult the data index to see
what you might be able to find with it.

In general, the expectation is that you may use the procedures in this
collection to identify specific hunting techniques that are of
interest to you, then follow the included references to read more and
actually learn how to perform those hunts.

## Special Thanks

Like many community projects, this wouldn't be possible without the
work of a lot of other people.

First and foremost, I'd like to thank all those brave hunters who
share their techniques with the world. The ThreatHunting Project is
only a catalog; the hunters who developed and published their
procedures did the hard work and we thank them for it.

Second, I'd like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to

you are much appreciated.
