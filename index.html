<p>Threat hunting is a popular topic these days, and there are a lot of people who want to get started but don't know how.  What should they hunt for?  How should they perform the hunts?  What data will they need to collect?</p>

<p>On the other hand, there are a lot of individuals out there who have written blog posts, conference presentations or whatever that detail some of their favorite hunting procedures.  The problem is that they are scattered and sometimes hard to find.</p>

<p>That's why the ThreatHunting Project exists.  Here you will find links to a number of different published hunting procedures. It my hope that this will give you some concrete starting points, or if you are an experienced hunter, help you find additional techniques to add to your repertoire.  </p>

<a id="organization" class="anchor" href="#organization" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Organization</h2>

<p>The core of this repository are the techniques in the <a href="https://github.com/DavidJBianco/ThreatHunting/tree/master/hunts">hunts</a> directory.  Each technique gets it's own file, which contains a brief summary the what the technique is good for, what data it requires and any other important highlights.  Each file also contains references (usually in the form of links) to sources that describe the technique more fully.</p>

<p>In general, the expectation is that you may use the files in this collection to identify specific hunting techniques that are of interest to you, then follow the included references to read more and actually learn how to do it.</p>

<a id="special-thanks" class="anchor" href="#special-thanks" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Special Thanks</h2>

<p>Like many community projects, this wouldn't be possible without the work of a lot of other people.</p>

<p>First and foremost, I'd like to thank all those brave hunters who share their techniques with the world.  The ThreatHunting Project is only a catalog; the hunters who developed and published their procedures did the hard work and we thank them for it.</p>

<p>Second, I'd like to personally thank everyone who has contributed to this repo.  Your contributions make it a little better every time, and you are much appreciated.</p>
